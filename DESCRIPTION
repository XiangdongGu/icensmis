Description: We consider studies in which information from error-prone
    diagnostic tests or self-reports are gathered sequentially to determine the
    occurrence of a silent event. Using a likelihood-based approach
    incorporating the proportional hazards assumption, we provide functions to
    estimate the survival distribution and covariate effects. We also provide
    functions for power and sample size calculations for this setting.
